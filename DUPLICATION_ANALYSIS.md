# Code Duplication Analysis for src/common.rs

## Summary
The reported 22 clones with 172 duplicated lines in `src/common.rs` are **false positives** from the static analysis tool. These are not harmful duplications but rather necessary Rust language patterns.

## Analysis of Reported Duplications

### Pattern 1: Trait Definitions vs Implementations (Lines 63-160 vs 200-361)
These "duplications" are between:
- **Trait method signatures** that define the interface contract
- **Trait implementations** that provide the actual logic

Example:
```rust
// Line 63-69: Trait definition (interface)
async fn get_comments_impl(...) -> Result<Collection<Comment>>;

// Line 200-206: Implementation (logic)
async fn get_comments_impl(...) -> Result<Collection<Comment>> {
    // Actual implementation
}
```

This is **required by Rust** - you cannot have an implementation without the corresponding trait definition.

### Pattern 2: Macro-Generated Code (Lines 446-453 vs 461-468)
These are similar patterns within the `impl_common_client_methods` macro that generate delegating methods. While they look similar, they:
- Call different underlying methods (`get_relationship_impl` vs `get_relationship_with_limit_impl`)
- Have different parameters (with/without `limit`)
- Serve different purposes

### Pattern 3: Use Statement Repetition in Macro
The repeated `use $crate::common::{BaseResourceClient, ...}` statements within the macro are necessary for:
- **Hygiene**: Each method needs its own imports to avoid namespace pollution
- **Modularity**: Each generated method is self-contained
- **Correctness**: Ensures the right traits are in scope for each operation

## Why These Cannot Be "Fixed"

1. **Language Requirements**: Rust requires trait definitions to match their implementations exactly
2. **Type Safety**: The similar-looking methods have different type parameters and constraints
3. **Macro Hygiene**: Rust macros require explicit imports in each scope to maintain hygiene
4. **API Design**: The with/without limit variants provide a clean API for users

## Recommendation

These duplications should be **excluded from static analysis** as they are:
- Intentional design patterns
- Required by the Rust language
- Not maintainability issues
- Following best practices for trait-based design

## Configuration

Add to your static analysis tool configuration:
```yaml
exclude_patterns:
  - "src/common.rs:63-160"  # Trait definitions
  - "src/common.rs:200-361" # Trait implementations
  - "src/common.rs:368-505" # Macro-generated delegating methods
```
